The Dark Side of the Moon is the eighth album of progressive rock band Pink Floyd; it details in an anthology-like structure some of the problems and worries that plague   society. From War, Money and Time to Death and what lies beyond Life itself, the album touches several topics in a plethora of ways characteristic of Pink Floyd's varied style. It is rumoured that this album had immense influence from Syd Barrett, even if the album was made after his departure from the band.
<p>Pink Floyd was an english rock band formed in 1964, originally formed by Bassist Roger Waters, Drummer Nick Mason, Pianist Richard Wright and Guitarrist Syd Barrett. Starting as a cheerful band, similar to the Beatles, fate would slowly but surely shift Pink Floyd's tone to one more grim and serious due to misfortune after misfortune that the band had to suffer through.</p>
<p>In these album top three, I will give a brief introduction to the album and the band, and then proceed to talk further about some songs I find interesting or good.</p>
<h2>Time</h2>
<p>Time is interesting, because it plays with the theme of running out of time, showing it in the progression of the song itself, with a guitar solo so much earlier than what is standard for a rock song, and the singer itself stopping before the song finishes, and David Guilmour, the replacement Guitarrist after Syd Barrett left the band, having to finish the song.</p>
<h2>Us and Them</h2>
<p>Us and Them touches on the horrors of war, seen from different perspectives, and how in the end, it's just a mess where very few truly benefit from. The song refers to war as a binary perspective, black and white, up and down, and so forth. The overall feeling of the song is how the ordinary men, which is pretty much all of us, only suffer from it, and that War at its core is just pointless death.</p>
