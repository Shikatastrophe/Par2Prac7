<p>I am also a massive fan of Rhythm Games. I've played all the rhythm games I've been able to find and get my hands on, always trying to find new and exciting ways to groove with music as I play a game. Other than DDR style games (Osumania, FNF), it was tough to find a game that was fun and enticing for me, until I finally found the crowning jewel for all rhythm games, in my opinion at least.</p>
<p>Rhythm Heaven Fever for the Nintendo Wii is rhythm game perfection. It is one of the few games that you can play blindfolded, only having to press two buttons, the couldn't be simpler, and that's what makes it amazing in my opinion.</p>
<p>The game has a very low skill floor, making everyone able to play it, but it has a deceivingly high skill ceiling, making only the best of the best be able to get a perfect score in all 50 minigames.</p>
<p>The music is also incredibly good, super charming and catchy, making it the perfect pair for snappy controls, and fun mechanics.</p>
<p>It may not be a traditional game in the sense, but it is what a rhythm game should aspire to be, in my opinion.
