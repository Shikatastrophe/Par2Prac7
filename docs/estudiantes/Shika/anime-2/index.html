<p>One Piece needs no introduction; being the most popular anime because of its length, Eiichiro Oda's work of fiction has made rounds all over the world with its stunning narrative and breathtaking panels. The manga originated in 1999 and the anime followed soon after just two years later. Luffy's tale is a long, but satisfying display of talent both in writing, drawing and worldbuilding.</p>
<p>Everywhere you look in this tale, the world is brimming with life and feels complete and alive even if the protagonists aren't there. Every single island and country they visit in the journey feels like it evolves and grows, even if we don't see that growth directly.</p>
<p>There are several important characters to the story, even those who feel minor and insignificant, sooner or later are shown to have greater significance to the story, but of course, it could be criminal to talk about this anime and not mention the main man himself, Monkey D. Luffy. Luffy is an interesting protagonist because for the most part of the anime, the feats he achieves come not from overpowered sources or plot, but rather his free spirit and imagination. His natural talent of pulling people towards him and his ability to care for those he loves, makes him a compelling character in a world full of what could only be considered cruelty and corruption all around.</p>
